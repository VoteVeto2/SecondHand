# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Student Second-Hand Marketplace Platform

## Product Overview

### Product Vision

To create a comprehensive web-based marketplace that accelerates second-hand goods exchange among students by providing real-time availability tracking and seamless appointment booking functionality, eliminating communication friction and enhancing user experience.

### Problem Statement

Current student marketplaces face critical pain points:

- **Availability Ambiguity**: Buyers cannot easily determine whether items are sold, reserved, or available for purchase[^1][^2]
- **Communication Overhead**: Constant messaging between buyers and sellers to coordinate viewing times creates friction[^3][^4]
- **Calendar Management**: Lack of automated scheduling leads to missed appointments and inefficient time management[^5][^6]


### Success Metrics

- **Primary**: 70% reduction in buyer-seller messaging for availability inquiries
- **Secondary**: 60% increase in successful item viewings through automated scheduling
- **Tertiary**: 85% user satisfaction score for the appointment booking experience


## Market Research \& Competitive Analysis

### Existing Marketplace Landscape

Current platforms like Vinted, Depop, and Facebook Marketplace offer basic listing functionality but lack sophisticated availability management[^1][^2]. Student-specific platforms such as the "Second Hand" GitHub project demonstrate demand for campus-focused solutions[^7], while specialized booking systems like Acuity Scheduling and Google Calendar Appointments show the viability of integrated scheduling[^3][^5].

### Target User Analysis

**Primary Users**: University and college students aged 18-25
**Personas**:

- **Sellers**: Students decluttering dorms, graduating students selling furniture/electronics
- **Buyers**: Incoming students, budget-conscious learners seeking affordable goods
